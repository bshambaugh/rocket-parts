The nose cone for this directory is based on the Tangent Ogive Formula given
in: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nose_cone_design . The Formula produces a curve, and it is revolved around an axis to produce a nose cone.

Calculations are in the LibreOffice Calc file nose-cone.ods.

An export of the produced points from the Formula are given in ogive-points.csv.

A Salome-Meca Geometry file of the nose cone produced by revolving the points
about the x-axis is given in noseCone.hdf. 

An image of the vectorized plotted curve from the points is ogive-curve.png.

An stl file of the nose cone (surface of revolution) is in Revolution_1.stl.
